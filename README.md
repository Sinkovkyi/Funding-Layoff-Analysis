# Analysis Layoff Dynamics


This project is a visual way to understand where, when, and why companies are laying off employees. The dashboards highlight which industries and regions are most affected, at what stages layoffs happen most often, and how the situation has changed over time.

## Dashboard Components

### 1. Funding vs Layoffs by Company
- **Type**: Combined chart (bar + line)  
- **Purpose**: Visual comparison of two key metrics—funding raised and percentage of employees laid off—for each company.  
- **Insight**: Highlights how different companies balance funding with workforce management decisions.

### 2. Percentage Laid Off by Stage
- **Type**: Pie chart  
- **Purpose**: Shows how layoffs are distributed across different funding stages (e.g., Seed, Series A, B).  
- **Insight**: Identifies the stages in a startup's lifecycle where layoffs occur most frequently.

### 3. Percentage Laid Off by Location
- **Type**: Horizontal bar chart  
- **Purpose**: Compares layoff percentages across different geographical locations.  
- **Insight**: Highlights regions with the highest workforce reductions.

### 4. Total Employees Laid Off Over Time
- **Type**: Line chart  
- **Purpose**: Displays the trend of layoffs over time (by year and month).  
- **Insight**: Allows observation of peaks and dips in overall staff reductions.

### 5. Layoffs by Industry
- **Type**: Horizontal bar chart  
- **Purpose**: Compares the percentage of layoffs across different industries.  
- **Insight**: Pinpoints sectors most vulnerable to workforce downsizing.
