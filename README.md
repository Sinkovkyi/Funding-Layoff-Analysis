## Dashboard Components

### 1. Funding vs Layoffs by Company

- Purpose: Visual comparison of two key metrics—funding raised and percentage of employees laid off—for each company.
- Insight: Highlights how different companies balance funding with workforce management decisions.

### 2. Percentage Laid Off by Stage
- Type: Pie chart
- Purpose: Shows how layoffs are distributed across different funding stages (e.g., Seed, Series A, B).
- Insight: Identifies the stages in a startup's lifecycle where layoffs occur most frequently.

### 3. Percentage Laid Off by Location
- Type: Horizontal bar chart
- Purpose: Compares layoff percentages across different geographical locations.
- Insight: Highlights regions with the highest workforce reductions.

### 4. Total Employees Laid Off Over Time
- Type: Line chart
- Purpose: Displays the trend of layoffs over time (by year).
- Insight: Allows observation of peaks and dips in overall staff reductions.

### 5. Layoffs by Industry
- Type: Horizontal bar chart
- Purpose: Compares the percentage of layoffs across different industries.
- Insight: Pinpoints sectors most vulnerable to workforce downsizing.
